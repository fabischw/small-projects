# small projects / scripts
- This repository includes very small, non-documented projects
- the reason why I'm uploading these is wanting to be able to easily access and distribute these projects

## Notes:
- I know the coding is horrible in some of these small scripts
- some of these scripts date back to the time when I started learning coding and don't serve a real purpose
- since these scripts are not super complex, they are free to useunder the GNU General Public License v3.0 unless something else is stated in the file itself
