# file encrypter
This is a small script to encrypt / decrypt files, nothing special, just a small script I need for personal use, feel free to use it as well ;D

- that this script does NOT encrypt the file content but rather the file itself which means some files might break (see list below for file types)


### files which this script has been tested on:
